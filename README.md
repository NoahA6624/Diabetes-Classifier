## Running the code

1. Make sure you have the CSV downloaded!!
It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/diabetes-clinical-dataset100k-rows?resource=download).

2. Install Jupyter Notebook or open file in [Jupyter Notebook online](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb).

3. Place the downloaded csv from above in the same directory as the jupyter notebook file.

4. Make sure all dependencies are installed by running the first code block.

5. Click "run all" at the top of the notebook to run each chunk of code, or click on each chuck then "run" to run them individually. Note that running chucks out of order may result in errors.

You should now see all outputs, including graphs and accuracy scores, for both the KNN model and the logistic regression model.
